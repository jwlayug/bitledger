## Bitledger Contributor Guidelines

Interested in contributing to Bitledger? Great! Here are a few instructions get you started.


### Asking questions and reporting issues

Often the easiest way to get a question answered is via IRC. You can find us at [#bitledger](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=bitledger) on Freenode, and you might also want to [search the channel logs](https://botbot.me/freenode/bitledger) beforehand, too.

Otherwise, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/cbeams/bitledger/issues) here via the GitHub Issues interface.


### Pull requests

Patches in the form of [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) are welcome, and we ask that you sign our
[Contributor License Agreement](https://www.clahub.com/agreements/cbeams/bitledger) the first time you contribute. We do this using [CLAHub's](http://www.clahub.com) excellent integration with GitHub, so the process is pretty easy.

There are a few exceptions to the CLA signing rule. You can skip this step if your patch:

 - fixes grammar or spelling errors
 - makes a single-line change to any documentation
 - fixes markup formatting or syntax errors

> _Note: If you're not already familiar, it's worth taking a moment to educate yourself as to why every free and open source project [should][1] [have][2] [a][3] [CLA](4). Hopefully we've made working with ours as simple as possible, but feedback is always welcome!_


### Coding conventions

_This section will be filled out in detail later, but for now, just follow suit with the conventions you already see in existing code._


### Commit like a pro

If you're not already familiar, please read and follow Pro Git's [Commit Guidelines](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/Distributed-Git-Contributing-to-a-Project#Commit-Guidelines). When in doubt, just take a look through Bitledger's commit history and follow suit.


### Expect discussion and rework

For anything other than trivial fixes, there will probably be some discussion involved before your pull request is merged. If you're thinking about a significant change, it's a good idea to discuss it with the team first, before spending a lot of time putting together a pull request.
